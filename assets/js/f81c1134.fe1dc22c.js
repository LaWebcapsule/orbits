But when an application interacts with multiple databases or connects to various APIs (as is the case for most applications today), the guarantees of ACID are lost. Workflows, state machines, and the saga pattern help achieve a similar level of reliability, often at the cost of more complex code. Here, we introduce a **Node.js** framework that makes it easy to write such workflows in TypeScript.\\n\\nTo follow along, you can find the full source code in [Orbit\u2019s GitHub repository](https://github.com/LaWebcapsule/orbits/tree/main/samples/orchestrate-lambda).\\n\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Why explicitly orchestrate workflows?\\n\\nLet\'s take a common use case in a business application: **managing a stock trading transaction**.\\n\\nHere are the typical steps:\\n1. Check the price of a stock\\n2. Generate a buy or sell recommendation\\n3. Execute the recommended action\\n\\nOn the surface, these are simple asynchronous calls that could be chained in a function:\\n\\n```javascript\\nasync function trade() {\\n  const stockPrice = await checkPrice();\\n  const recommendation = await generateRecommendation(stockPrice);\\n  return recommendation === \'buy\' ? await buyStock(stockPrice) : await sellStock(stockPrice);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBut in reality, problems accumulate:\\n- What to do if a third-party service fails?\\n- What if a network error occurs?\\n- If the Node.js process is interrupted, the trade stops halfway, with no memory of the ongoing buy/sell operation.\\n\\nThese issues, far from being theoretical, can have financial consequences. For example, a buy or sell action that is forgotten or left halfway through can lead to losses for the company.\\n\\n## The Saga Orchestration Pattern\\n\\nThe [**Saga Orchestration Pattern**](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html) effectively addresses these challenges. By centralizing workflow management in an orchestrator, this pattern mimics the transaction principle of a database. It allows a series of atomic actions, executed sequentially and under control, to be linked together into a global transaction.\\n\\nThe orchestrator:\\n- Explicitly manages state transitions between each step.\\n- Persists workflow state to ensure recovery after crashes.\\n- Can replay actions in case of transient failure.\\n- Provides detailed traceability through clear naming of each step.\\n\\nThus, the Saga Orchestration pattern not only guarantees resilience and consistency of operations but also facilitates maintenance, monitoring, and evolution of complex workflows in a distributed environment.\\n\\n## Use Case\\n\\nIn this blog post, we revisit the example of orchestrating a banking transaction. This canonical example was provided by [AWS Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/sample-lambda-orchestration.html) and [Temporal](https://temporal.io/blog/temporal-replaces-state-machines-for-distributed-applications). Readers can refer to these articles to compare the syntax and ease of implementation offered by each tool.\\n\\n## The Implementation\\n\\nOrbits proposes writing workflows in a structured and declarative manner.\\nYou can explore and experiment with the full source code of the example described in this blog post in [Orbit\u2019s GitHub repository](https://github.com/LaWebcapsule/orbits/tree/main/samples/orchestrate-lambda).  \\nHere\'s the concrete example:\\n\\n```typescript title=\\"src/orbits/workflows/trading.ts\\" wordWrap=true\\nexport class TradingWorkflow extends Workflow{\\n\\n declare IResult:StockTransaction\\n\\n async define(){\\n  const checkPrice = await this.do(\\"check-price\\", new CheckStockPriceAction());\\n  const stockPrice = checkPrice.stockPrice;\\n\\n  const buyOrSell = await this.do(\\"recommandation\\", \\n    new GenerateBuySellRecommendationAction()\\n    .setArgument(\\n        {\\n            price:stockPrice.stock_price\\n        })\\n    ); \\n\\n\\n  if (buyOrSell.buyOrSellRecommendation === \'sell\') {\\n    const sell = await this.do(\\"sell\\", new SellStockeAction().setArgument({\\n            price:stockPrice.stock_price\\n    }));\\n    return sell.stockData;\\n  } else {\\n    const buy = await this.do(\\"buy\\", new BuyStockAction().setArgument({\\n            price:stockPrice.stock_price\\n    }));\\n    return buy.stockData;\\n  }\\n };\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis central workflow orchestrates each step by calling autonomous **Actions**, while maintaining branching logic and intermediate states.\\n\\n- **Explicit orchestration**: The Orbits engine manages calls, errors, retries, and state persistence\\n- **Atomic actions**: Each business step is an independent and testable action\\n- **Conditional branching**: The workflow flow can diverge based on data (buy or sell). It does not differ from standard TypeScript code.\\n- **Extensibility**: We can easily add steps, compensation logic, monitoring\\n- **Resilience**: Handles crash recovery, workflow state, and observability\\n\\nEach step is defined as an **Orbits Action**.\\n\\nHere\'s the implementation of the buy action:\\n\\n```typescript\\nexport class BuyStockAction extends Action {\\n    async main() {\\n        const response = await fetch(API_ADDRESS + \'buyStock\', {\\n            method: \'POST\',\\n            headers: { \'Content-Type\': \'application/json\' },\\n            body: JSON.stringify({ stock_price: this.argument.price })\\n        });\\n        this.result.stockData = await response.json();\\n        return ActionState.SUCCESS;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis action:\\n- Takes a **typed input** (price)\\n- Calls a remote API in an encapsulated manner\\n- **Returns a state - ActionState.SUCCESS**, ready to be recorded and resumed\\n- Handles **errors by default via a state - ActionState.ERROR**\\n\\nThis structuring makes the action not only **easy to test in isolation** but also **reusable in different workflows**, while simplifying its instrumentation for monitoring or debugging.\\n\\n## Workflow Visualization\\n\\nHere\'s a schematic representation of the orchestrated process:\\n\\n```mermaid\\nflowchart TD\\n    Start[\\"Start\\"] --\x3e CheckPrice[\\"CheckStockPrice\\"]\\n    CheckPrice --\x3e GenerateRec[\\"GenerateRecommendation\\"]\\n    GenerateRec --\x3e Decision{\\"Buy or Sell?\\"}\\n    Decision --\x3e|Buy| BuyStock[\\"BuyStock\\"]\\n    Decision --\x3e|Sell| SellStock[\\"SellStock\\"]\\n    BuyStock --\x3e End[\\"End\\"]\\n    SellStock --\x3e End\\n```\\n\\n## Benefits Summary\\n\\nAdopting Orbits offers:\\n\\n**Standard TypeScript**\\n\\nOrbits is a standard TypeScript framework. You write promises and asynchronous functions just like you would anywhere else.\\n\\n**Clear separation of responsibilities**\\n- **Workflow** = orchestration\\n- **Action** = unit business logic\\n\\n**Flexibility & Scalability**\\n- We can modify the flow without touching business components\\n- Actions are reusable in multiple workflows\\n\\n**Resilience and recovery**\\n- Orbits manages state persistence\\n- Automatic recovery from the last valid point\\n\\n**Native observability**\\n- Each action is traceable, named, monitorable\\n\\n## Going further \\n\\n### Using lambdas async invocations\\n\\nFor the sake of hypothesis, let\u2019s assume our Lambda function runs for an extended period of time (which is not the case here). In such scenarios, there\u2019s a high chance that the initial HTTP call triggering the Lambda might fail unexpectedly\u2014due to a network issue or timeout, for example.\\n\\nTo prevent such failures from disrupting the overall workflow, you can configure retry policies.\\n\\nOrbits also supports asynchronous APIs and allows you to track execution status over time. When dealing with long-running Lambda functions, an Orbits action can return with an `ActionState.IN_PROGRESS`, and then delegate the follow-up logic to the `watcher()` [method](/documentation/core-concepts/action), which periodically checks the progress of the async process.\\n\\nThis approach requires a bit of additional setup, as you\u2019ll need to interact with the AWS Lambda API to track the specific invocation\u2019s result.\\n\\nWe\u2019ll cover how Orbits makes it easy to manage long-running processes in a dedicated blog post soon.\\n\\n### Using resources to manage concurrency\\n\\nIn our example, if we trigger the same order twice, it will be processed twice\u2014this isn\u2019t always the desired behavior.\\nOrbits provides an opinionated way to handle concurrency through a concept called resources. [Resources](/documentation/core-concepts/resource) allow you to control and limit the execution of actions to prevent unintended duplication.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWith the simplicity of **Orbits in Node.js**, we can build systems that are reliable, readable, and maintainable, without changing your coding practices.\\n\\nFor your critical processes \u2014 e-commerce, finance, logistics, etc. \u2014 **adopting such an approach will significantly reduce your bug rate and inconsistencies**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Learn more about Orbits and its capabilities in our [documentation](/documentation/quick-start).*"},{"id":"programmable-cdk8s-deployment","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/programmable-cdk8s-deployment","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-07-11-cdk8s-deployment.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-07-11-cdk8s-deployment.md","title":"Automate deployments of cdk8s template","description":"Cdk8s is a great tool to write your Kubernetes IaC templates using standard programming languages.

But unlike the [AWS cdk](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/cdk/), which is tightly integrated with CloudFormation to manage stack deployment, cdk8s has no native deployment mechanism.\\n\\nBy default, it allows you to synthesize manifests and deploy them using `kubectl apply`, or optionally through [Helm](https://helm.sh/). While both approaches can work, they often fall short for more advanced use cases \u2014 for example, when you want to programmatically chain deployments, export values from the chart, or implement a custom rollback and prune strategy.\\n\\nIn this blog post, we\u2019ll explain how we built a model-driven orchestrator for cdk8s using Orbits \u2014 a lightweight framework for orchestrating cloud resources and workflows. We\u2019ll show how you can use it, adapt it to your own needs, or even build your own orchestrator based on the same principles. If Orbits fits your use case, you can directly reuse what we\u2019ve built.\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The Need for cdk8s orchestration\\n\\nThere is no built-in way to programmatically and reliably deploy a cdk8s stack \u2014 especially outside of the AWS ecosystem.\\n\\nThe current options are:\\n- Synthesize the stack and apply it with `kubectl apply`\\n- Deploy the stack as a Helm chart\\n\\nBut both of these have shortcomings:\\n- They are not easily orchestrated programmatically \\n- Helm has known limitations when integrating with cdk8s\\n- There\u2019s no native support for retries, failover, or rollback\\n- There is no built-in mechanism to chain the deployment of multiple charts, especially if some charts are on one kube cluster and other on another kube cluster\\n- Helm\u2019s rollback model didn\u2019t align with our platform needs\\n\\nIn our case \u2014 building internal platforms for highly regulated environments \u2014 we needed more control. Our deployment flow had to:\\n- Configure cloud provider resources via API calls\\n- Deploy multiple charts programmatically in a precise order\\n- Use the results of deployments (like IPs or service names) to configure other infrastructure components\\n\\nGiven these needs, existing options were simply not enough.\\nWhat we were looking for resembled the CloudFormation model:\\n- Attempt a deployment\\n- Rollback to the previous state on failure\\n- On success, prune obsolete resources\\n- Output values that could be reused in subsequent steps\\n\\nAdditionally, we needed:\\n- Safe concurrent executions, to allow multiple deployments at the same time without conflict\\n- Built-in retry policies for transient failures\\n\\nThese requirements led us to build a dedicated orchestrator for cdk8s using Orbits \u2014 a model-driven orchestration engine designed for reliability and composability.\\n\\n## Final result\\n\\nThe result is an Orbits resource that manages your cdk8s deployment.\\nYou can read the [orbits documentation](/documentation/helper/integrations/cdk8s-resource) on how to use it.\\n\\n- You can use it by extending the base class:\\n```typescript\\nexport class BasicResource extends Cdk8sResource {\\n  StackConstructor = BasicChart ;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- Or dynamically assign a custom stack generation method:\\n```typescript\\nconst myCdk8sResource = new Cdk8sResource();\\nmyCdk8sResource.generateStack = ()=>{\\n    return new cdk8s.Chart(myCdk8sResource.app, \'empty-chart\')\\n}\\n\\nawait this.do(\\"update-stack\\", {dynamicAction: myCdk8sResource});\\n```\\n\\n:::info Outputs \\nyou can export outputs, which allows you to chain charts or propagate values (like an IP address for DNS updates)\\n\\n```typescript\\nasync setOutput(){\\n        const stack = await this.generateStack();\\n        const apiServiceInfo = await this.kubeApi.coreApi.readNamespacedService({\\n            name: stack.loadBalancerService.name,\\n            namespace: stack.loadBalancerService.metadata.namespace || \'default\',\\n        })\\n        return apiServiceInfo.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip;\\n}\\n```\\n:::\\n\\n:::info Concurrency\\nConcurrency is also managed by Orbits. If a deployment is already running, concurrent executions will be serialized to prevent state corruption\\n```typescript\\n    //somewhere\\n    this.do(\\"deploy\\", new MyBasicChartResource())\\n    //elsewhere\\n    this.do(\\"deploy\\", new MyBasicChartResource())\\n```\\nThe two deployments will [coalesce](/documentation/core-concepts/resource#convergent-execution-coalescing).\\n:::\\n\\n:::info Crash-proof\\nOrbits is [crash-proof](/documentation/quick-start#workflow-a-chain-of-actions).\\nIf a crash occurs mid-deployment, Orbits will resume from the same step on restart.\\n:::\\n\\n## Implementation\\n\\nFrom a cdk8s chart, we want to:\\n- Deploy the chart reliably\\n- Retry on failure\\n- Rollback to the previous state if necessary\\n- Prune obsolete resources\\n\\n### The orbits Cdk8s resources\\n\\nIn Orbits, [resources](/documentation/core-concepts/resources) are stateful units that define hooks like defineUpdate.\\nFor the deployment of a cdk8s chart, we only need the `update` hook.\\nThe high-level flow of the resource implementation is as follows:\\n\\n```typescript \\nexport class Cdk8sResource{\\n    \\n    defineUpdate(){\\n        try{\\n            await this.do(\\"deploy\\", ...)\\n        }\\n        catch(err){\\n            this.bag.rollBackNeeded = true;\\n            await this.do(\\"rollback\\", ...)\\n        }\\n        finally{\\n            await this.do(\\"prune\\", ...)\\n        }\\n\\n        if(!this.bag.rollBackNeeded){\\n            await this.do(\\"storeNewChart\\", ...)\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```mermaid\\nflowchart TD\\n    Start[\\"Start\\"] --\x3e Deploy[\\"Deploy\\"]\\n    Deploy -- Success --\x3e FinallyPrune[\\"Prune\\"]\\n    Deploy -- Error --\x3e SetRollback[\\"Rollback\\"]\\n    SetRollback --\x3e FinallyPrune\\n    FinallyPrune --\x3e CheckRollbackFlag[\\"Deploy has been a success?\\"]\\n    CheckRollbackFlag -- Yes --\x3e Store[\\"Store new chart\\"]\\n    Store --\x3e End[\\"End\\"]\\n    CheckRollbackFlag -- No --\x3e End\\n\\n    CheckRollbackFlag@{ shape: rounded}\\n```\\n\\nThe complete implementation is available [here on github](https://github.com/LaWebcapsule/orbits/blob/main/helpers/src/standards-resource/cdk8s/cdk8s-resource.ts)\\n\\n#### Deploying the chart\\n\\nThere are multiple ways to deploy a stack, but we chose `kubectl apply` because it updates only the resources that changed. That means kubectl is required in the environment running the deployment.\\n\\n#### Ensuring the deployment is a success\\n\\nWe don\u2019t just fire and forget. We verify that critical resources are ready:\\n- All Deployments reach a ready state\\n- Certificates (e.g., from cert-manager) are marked as ready\\nThis check helps us ensure the cluster is in a stable and usable state before moving forward.\\n\\n#### Storing the latest chart\\n\\nWe store the chart contents in a Kubernetes Secret. The secret\u2019s name is generated based on the stack name:\\n```typescript\\nprivate genSecretName(): string {\\n        return `orbits.deployment.${this.argument.stackName}`;\\n}\\n```\\nThis allows the system to compare the current state with the previous one during rollback or pruning.\\n\\n#### Pruning unused resources\\n\\nPruning depends on whether the deployment succeeded:\\n- On success, we prune old resources\\n- On failure, we prune newly created resources\\n\\nWe compare the list of objects in the stored stack with the current state and remove the unneeded ones.\\nWe make sure to never delete:\\n- Namespaces\\n- PersistentVolumeClaims\\n\\n\\n### Key Benefits\\n\\n- CloudFormation-like rollback for Cdk8s chart\\n- Crash-safe and retryable deployments\\n- Safe concurrent operations\\n- Outputs and dependency chaining support\\n- Multi-tenants deployment support\\n\\n\\n## Looking Forward\\n\\nOur orchestrator provides a robust and flexible foundation for managing cdk8s deployments in production. While it already solves some pain points, we plan to improve:\\n- Improved diff tools to preview changes before applying them\\n- Extended tracking and monitoring of additional Kubernetes resources\\nAdditionally, the resource offers a promising starting point for implementing drift detection, but that topic will be covered in a future post.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*The source code of the CDk8SResource is available here: [https://github.com/LaWebcapsule/orbits/blob/main/helpers/src/standards-resource/cdk8s/cdk8s-resource.ts](https://github.com/LaWebcapsule/orbits/blob/main/helpers/src/standards-resource/cdk8s/cdk8s-resource.ts)*"},{"id":"cross-account-cdk","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/cross-account-cdk","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2025-06-25-cross-account-cdk.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-06-25-cross-account-cdk.md","title":"Solving cross-account resources for AWS CDK","description":"If you\'ve ever tried to build a multi-account AWS architecture using CDK or CloudFormation, you\'ve probably hit the same frustrating wall: cross-account resource references don\'t work without manual coordination and hardcoded values.

However, these approaches don\'t scale when you have multiple services and resources spanning different accounts across your organization.\\n\\nThis post walks through a practical example that demonstrates both the problem and a solution using orbits, a tool designed to seamless orchestrate all of your IaC with code.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n## The Cross-Account Problem\\n\\nAWS CDK and CloudFormation have a limitation: stacks cannot directly reference resources from other AWS accounts. This creates friction for common architectural patterns like:\\n\\n- Sharing Docker images between development and production accounts\\n- Accessing centralized secrets from distributed applications\\n- Setting up VPC peering connections\\n- Managing cross-account S3 bucket permissions\\n- Distributing Lambda layers across organizational boundaries\\n\\nHere\'s what this limitation looks like in practice:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst app = new cdk.App()\\n\\nconst paramA = new ParamStack(app, \'stack-A\', {\\n    env: { account: \\"account-A\\" }\\n})\\n\\nconst lambdaB = new LambdaStack(app, \'stack-B\', {\\n    parameterArn: paramA.parameter.arn, // \u274c This fails at synthesis time\\n    env: { account: \\"account-B\\" }\\n})\\n```\\n\\nThe traditional workaround involves manual steps: extracting ARNs, hardcoding values, coordinating resource policies, and deploying in specific sequences. This breaks the declarative nature of infrastructure-as-code and makes architectures brittle.\\n\\n## A Real-World Example\\n\\nHere\'s an \\"hello-world\\" scenario to illustrate the problem: deploying an AWS Systems Manager parameter in Account A and reading it from a Lambda function in Account B. While the \\"cross-account sharing\\" feature for AWS SSM parameter could be used, this simple use case illustrates the broader challenge perfectly.\\n\\n### The Traditional CDK Approach (Doesn\'t scale)\\n\\nWith standard CDK, you\'d need to:\\n\\n1. Deploy the parameter stack in Account A\\n2. Manually extract the parameter ARN\\n3. Hardcode the ARN into your Lambda stack for Account B\\n4. Manually configure cross-account IAM policies\\n5. Deploy the Lambda stack in Account B\\n6. Hope nothing changes, because updates require repeating this process\\n\\n### The Orchestration Solution with orbits\\n\\nWith orbits, the same architecture becomes straightforward:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst paramOutput = await this.do(\\"updateParam\\", new ParamResource());\\n\\nawait this.do(\\"updateLambda\\", new LambdaResource().setArgument({\\n    stackProps: {\\n        parameterArn: paramOutput.parameterArn, // \u2705 Direct cross-account reference\\n        env: { account: this.argument.accountB.id }\\n    }\\n}))\\n```\\n\\nThe key difference? Orbits handles the cross-account coordination automatically, allowing you to reference resources naturally regardless of which account they live in.\\n\\n## Hands-On: Building the Example\\n\\nThe following section walks through building this cross-account parameter example step by step.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nYou\'ll need:\\n- Access to two AWS accounts with CloudFormation deployment

Stack\\n\\nWe focus on two stack `LambdaStack` and `ParameterStoreStack`\\n[link to the stack]\\n\\n##### Lambda stack\\n\\nA lambda that will display the value of the parameter passed in parameter if it can access it.\\n\\n#### Parameter stack\\n\\nA parameter store that stores an \\"hello-world\\" value.\\n\\n\\n#### Encapsulate the stacks in a resource definition.\\n\\nHere\'s what a CDK resource definitions look like:\\n\\n\\n**Lambda Resource (lambda-resource.ts):**\\n```typescript title=\\"src/orbits/lambda-resource.ts\\"\\nexport class LambdaResource extends CdkStackResource{\\n    \\n    StackConstructor = LambdaStack;\\n\\n    declare IOutput : {\\n        \\"roleArn\\": string\\n    } \\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s go line by line.\\n- `StackConstructor = LambdaStack` : this tells the orchestrator that `LambdaResource` will use the `LambdaStack` class constructor to define and manage its infrastructure.\\n- \\n```typescript \\ndeclare IOutput : {\\n        \\"roleArn\\": string\\n} \\n```\\nThe CloudFormation stack for the Lambda function exports a single output: \\"roleArn\\", which is the ARN of the Lambda\'s execution role.\\nThe IOutput declaration is used for type safety\u2014it informs the developer that this resource will expose an output matching that structure.\\n\\n:::info\\nIf not already done, the CDK environment will be automatically bootstrapped by the CDKResource\u2014no other step is required, the fulllifecycle of your resource is managed.\\n:::\\n\\n#### Write a proxy resource to orchestrate both lambda and param deployment\\n\\nWe could choose different orchestrations stategies.\\nHere we choose to have a proxy resources that deploy both the `Param` and the `Lambda` stack and that synchronize the use of both in coordination.\\n\\n##### Install step\\n\\nDuring the first step, we launch a first deployment of the `Lambda` stack.\\nAt this step, the `ParamStore` stack does not exist, so no optional properties are passed.\\n```typescript src=\\"src/orbits/hello-resource.ts\\"\\nasync defineInstall(){\\n        await this.do(\\"firstDeployLambda\\", this.constructLambdaResource());\\n}\\n\\nconstructLambdaResource(){\\n        return new LambdaResource().setArgument({\\n            stackName: \\"lambda\\",\\n            awsProfileName: this.argument.accountB.profile,\\n            stackProps: {\\n                env: {\\n                    region: this.argument.region,\\n                    account: this.argument.accountB.id\\n                }\\n            }\\n        })\\n}\\n```\\n\\n##### Update step\\n\\nWhen updating the resource, we deploy both the `Param` and `Lambda` stack.\\n```typescript src=\\"src/orbits/hello-resource.ts\\"\\nasync defineUpdate(){\\n        const lambdaResource = this.constructLambdaResource();\\n\\n        const lambdaOutput = await this.do(\\"getLambdaOutput\\", ()=>{\\n            return lambdaResource.getResourceOutput();\\n        })\\n\\n        const paramOutput = await this.do(\\"updateParam\\", this.constructParamResource(lambdaOutput));\\n\\n        await this.do(\\"updateLambda\\", this.constructLambdaResource(paramOutput))\\n}\\n```\\n\\n`ParamResource` consumes the output of `LambdaResource` and vice versa.\\nAs a consequence, we need to refine the constructs methods.\\n\\n```typescript src=\\"src/orbits/hello-resource.ts\\"\\n    constructLambdaResource(paramOutput? : ParamResource[\'IOutput\']){\\n        return new LambdaResource().setArgument({\\n            stackName: \\"lambda\\",\\n            awsProfileName: this.argument.accountB.profile,\\n            stackProps: {\\n                accountARoleArn: paramOutput?.roleArn,\\n                parameterArn: paramOutput?.paramArn,\\n                env: {\\n                    region: this.argument.region,\\n                    account: this.argument.accountB.id\\n                }\\n            }\\n        })\\n    }\\n\\n    constructParamResource(lambdaOutput? : LambdaResource[\'IOutput\']){\\n        return new ParamResource().setArgument({\\n            stackName: \\"param\\",\\n            awsProfileName: this.argument.accountA.profile,\\n            stackProps: {\\n                accountBId: this.argument.accountB.id,\\n                accountBRoleArn: lambdaOutput.roleArn,\\n                env: {\\n                    region: this.argument.region,\\n                    account: this.argument.accountA.id\\n                }\\n            }\\n        })\\n    }\\n```\\n\\n#### Uninstall step\\n\\nTo uninstall, we uninstall both the `Lambda` and `ParamStore` stacks.\\n\\n```typescript src=\\"src/orbits/hello-resource.ts\\"\\nasync defineUninstall(){\\n        await this.do(\\"uninstallLambda\\", this.constructLambdaResource().setCommand(\\"Uninstall\\"));\\n        await this.do(\\"uninstallParam\\", this.constructParamResource().setCommand(\\"Uninstall\\"))\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Deployment\\n\\nThe entire cross-account deployment happens with a single command:\\n\\n```bash\\nexport $(cat .env | xargs)\\nexport ORBITS_DB__MONGO__URL=your-mongo-url\\nnpx tsx src/orbits/orbi.ts\\n```\\n\\nThis orchestrates:\\n1. Parameter deployment in Account A\\n2. Cross-account IAM policy setup\\n3. Lambda function deployment in Account B\\n4. All necessary permissions and configurations\\n\\n#### Verification\\n\\nAfter deployment, you can test the Lambda function in Account B. It will successfully retrieve the parameter from Account A, demonstrating seamless cross-account access.\\n\\nThe Lambda logs will show:\\n```\\nParam: hello-world\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Cleanup\\nTo remove all deployed resources from both accounts:\\n```bash\\nexport HELLO_COMMAND=uninstall\\nnpx tsx src/orbits/orbi.ts\\n```\\n\u26a0\ufe0f Warning: This will permanently delete all resources created by this example. Make sure you want to remove everything before running this command.\\n\\n## Why This Matters\\n\\nThis example might seem simple, but it represents a fundamental gain in how we think about multi-account architectures. Instead of treating cross-account access as an exception requiring special handling, orbits makes it a first-class citizen of your infrastructure-as-code workflow. It allows to completly automate cross-account resources definition.\\n\\n### Key Benefits\\n\\n**Declarative Cross-Account Resources:** Reference any resource from any account without manual coordination.\\n\\n**Automatic Permission Management:** IAM policies and resource policies are handled automatically.\\n\\n**Consistent Deployment Experience:** Multi-account deployments feel the same as single-account ones.\\n\\n**Simplified Maintenance:** Updates and changes don\'t require manual ARN extraction and policy coordination.\\n\\n## Looking Forward\\n\\nCross-account resource management shouldn\'t be a second-class citizen in your infrastructure-as-code workflow. Tools like orbits point toward a future where account boundaries enhance security without sacrificing developer experience.\\n\\nIf you\'re building multi-account architectures, I encourage you to try this example and see how much simpler cross-account resource management can be. The days of manual ARN extraction and policy coordination don\'t have to be permanent fixtures of AWS multi-account architectures.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Ready to try it yourself?

Yes, infrastructure has always been code: from the Ubuntu web server to the Cockroach database, it is nothing but code controlled by code. But if the Ops field has progressively shifted towards the notion of Infrastructure as Code, it is precisely because there is a substantial difference: the DevOps domain is better formalized as a description of reproducible artifacts rather than as a prescription of successive commands to execute.\\nThus, boldly displaying this slogan *Infra is code!* on any article should make any somewhat experienced DevOps practitioner pause.\\n\\nYet, friend reading these lines, don\u2019t go away so quickly! Haven\u2019t you already felt that while DevOps improved developers\u2019 lives with democratization of virtualization, convergence of interfaces, and unprecedented deployment speed, infrastructure itself remained, tucked away in some Git annex, a poor relative of computer code \u2014 difficult to edit, inflexible, and slow to test?\\nThe popular wisdom among developers seems to say: the less you touch infrastructure, the better off you are.\\nWith this, tirelessly, we arrive at a state-of-the-art where:\\n\\n- every project [restarts infrastructure work](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1l8dsax/whats_eating_up_most_of_your_time_as_a_devops/) as if its neighbor didn\u2019t exist\\n- building a service stack remains a patchwork, a [conglomerate of loosely connected elements](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2023.2229347)\\n- it is difficult, [without manual intervention, to redeploy an app from scratch on a new environment](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/documents/576/2019_019_001_539335.pdf).\\n- apps are [hardly portable from one cloud to another](https://theses.hal.science/tel-02798770/file/90479_BRABRA_2020_archivage-4.pdf) \u2014 and the question of sovereignty is, out of frustration, abandoned.\\n\\nFinally, all in all, a large part of DevOps activity remains manual, and the trust chain in the system relies on a chain of responsibility and a comprehensive understanding of the system by a few operators in the team (which is positive) rather than on appropriate tooling (which is disappointing because, as system complexity grows, [relying solely on knowledge leads to rigid systems](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74183-3_4)).\\n\\nConsequently, we unanimously demand that infrastructure specifications have the same rights and level of citizenship as any other piece of code in the stack.\\n\\nA demand that could remain dead letter if it were not accompanied by two recommendations:\\n\\norchestrators offer infrastructure an opportunity for liberation that it can seize to obtain its citizenship rights. The engineering platform movement has made a strong commitment in this direction and orchestration must be at the center of efforts.\\n\\nincreasingly, infrastructure benefits from being written in standard code: CDKs bear witness to the direction to follow. This allows a convergence of best practices between infrastructure and code.\\n\\nThus, IaC must be enhanced, orchestrated, and managed \u2014 as much as possible through standard code.\\nWe began working under these assumptions three years ago, and it has allowed us to build numerous engineering platforms since then. As we found nothing that met our criteria, we built our own orchestration framework: Orbits (aka Orbi.ts).\\nIt is now mature enough to fly on its own: since freedom is not won alone, we present it today to the community, hoping it can help build infrastructures and deployment pipelines that are more flexible, more robust, and more sovereign."}]}}')}}]);
