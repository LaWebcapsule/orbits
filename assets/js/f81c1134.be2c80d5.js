What should be a simple task\u2014like reading a parameter from Account A in a Lambda function deployed to Account B\u2014becomes a tedious manual process. This behaviour is already [documented](https://www.luminis.eu/blog/cross-account-aws-resource-access-with-aws-cdk/) and while AWS also documents [workarounds](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/walkthrough-crossstackref.html), there\u2019s no indication that this is going to change anytime soon. However, these approaches don\'t scale when you have multiple services and resources spanning different accounts across your organization.\\n\\nThis post walks through a practical example that demonstrates both the problem and a solution using orbits, a tool designed to seamless orchestrate all of your IaC with code.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n## The Cross-Account Problem\\n\\nAWS CDK and CloudFormation have a limitation: stacks cannot directly reference resources from other AWS accounts. This creates friction for common architectural patterns like:\\n\\n- Sharing Docker images between development and production accounts\\n- Accessing centralized secrets from distributed applications\\n- Setting up VPC peering connections\\n- Managing cross-account S3 bucket permissions\\n- Distributing Lambda layers across organizational boundaries\\n\\nHere\'s what this limitation looks like in practice:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst app = new cdk.App()\\n\\nconst paramA = new ParamStack(app, \'stack-A\', {\\n    env: { account: \\"account-A\\" }\\n})\\n\\nconst lambdaB = new LambdaStack(app, \'stack-B\', {\\n    parameterArn: paramA.parameter.arn, // \u274c This fails at synthesis time\\n    env: { account: \\"account-B\\" }\\n})\\n```\\n\\nThe traditional workaround involves manual steps: extracting ARNs, hardcoding values, coordinating resource policies, and deploying in specific sequences. This breaks the declarative nature of infrastructure-as-code and makes architectures brittle.\\n\\n## A Real-World Example\\n\\nHere\'s an \\"hello-world\\" scenario to illustrate the problem: deploying an AWS Systems Manager parameter in Account A and reading it from a Lambda function in Account B. While the \\"cross-account sharing\\" feature for AWS SSM parameter could be used, this simple use case illustrates the broader challenge perfectly.\\n\\n### The Traditional CDK Approach (Doesn\'t scale)\\n\\nWith standard CDK, you\'d need to:\\n\\n1. Deploy the parameter stack in Account A\\n2. Manually extract the parameter ARN\\n3. Hardcode the ARN into your Lambda stack for Account B\\n4. Manually configure cross-account IAM policies\\n5. Deploy the Lambda stack in Account B\\n6. Hope nothing changes, because updates require repeating this process\\n\\n### The Orchestration Solution with orbits\\n\\nWith orbits, the same architecture becomes straightforward:\\n\\n```typescript\\nconst paramOutput = await this.do(\\"updateParam\\", new ParamResource());\\n\\nawait this.do(\\"updateLambda\\", new LambdaResource().setArgument({\\n    stackProps: {\\n        parameterArn: paramOutput.parameterArn, // \u2705 Direct cross-account reference\\n        env: { account: this.argument.accountB.id }\\n    }\\n}))\\n```\\n\\nThe key difference? Orbits handles the cross-account coordination automatically, allowing you to reference resources naturally regardless of which account they live in.\\n\\n## Hands-On: Building the Example\\n\\nThe following section walks through building this cross-account parameter example step by step.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\nYou\'ll need:\\n- Access to two AWS accounts with CloudFormation deployment permissions\\n- Node.js and npm installed\\n- MongoDB instance for orbits state management\\n\\n### Project Setup\\n\\n```bash\\n# Clone the repository\\ngit clone <repository-url>\\ncd cross-account-example\\n\\n# Install dependencies\\nnpm install\\n\\n# Configure environment\\ncp .base.env .env\\n# Edit .env with your account details\\nvi .env\\n```\\n\\n### Project structure\\n\\n```bash\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 orbits/\\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 orbi.ts # Main orchestration script\\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500

         # Your environment variables (git-ignored)\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 README.md\\n```\\n\\n### The Resource Definitions\\n\\n#### Lambda and Param CDK Stack\\n\\nWe focus on two stack `LambdaStack` and `ParameterStoreStack`\\n[link to the stack]\\n\\n##### Lambda stack\\n\\nA lambda that will display the value of the parameter passed in parameter if it can access it.\\n\\n#### Parameter stack\\n\\nA parameter store that stores an \\"hello-world\\" value.\\n\\n\\n#### Encapsulate the stacks in a resource definition.\\n\\nHere\'s what a CDK resource definitions look like:\\n\\n\\n**Lambda Resource (lambda-resource.ts):**\\n```typescript title=\\"src/orbits/lambda-resource.ts\\"\\nexport class LambdaResource extends CdkStackResource{\\n    \\n    StackConstructor = LambdaStack;\\n\\n    declare IOutput : {\\n        \\"roleArn\\": string\\n    } \\n}\\n```\\n\\nLet\'s go line by line.\\n- `StackConstructor = LambdaStack` : this tells the orchestrator that `LambdaResource` will use the `LambdaStack` class constructor to define and manage its infrastructure.\\n- \\n```typescript \\ndeclare IOutput : {\\n        \\"roleArn\\": string\\n} \\n```\\nThe CloudFormation stack for the Lambda function exports a single output: \\"roleArn\\", which is the ARN of the Lambda\'s execution role.\\nThe IOutput declaration is used for type safety\u2014it informs the developer that this resource will expose an output matching that structure.\\n\\n:::info\\nIf not already done, the CDK environment will be automatically bootstrapped by the CDKResource\u2014no other step is required, the fulllifecycle of your resource is managed.\\n:::\\n\\n#### Write a proxy resource to orchestrate both lambda and param deployment\\n\\nWe could choose different orchestrations stategies.\\nHere we choose to have a proxy resources that deploy both the `Param` and the `Lambda` stack and that synchronize the use of both in coordination.\\n\\n##### Install step\\n\\nDuring the first step, we launch a first deployment of the `Lambda` stack.\\nAt this step, the `ParamStore` stack does not exist, so no optional properties are passed.\\n```typescript src=\\"src/orbits/hello-resource.ts\\"\\nasync defineInstall(){\\n        await this.do(\\"firstDeployLambda\\", this.constructLambdaResource());\\n}\\n\\nconstructLambdaResource(){\\n        return new LambdaResource().setArgument({\\n            stackName: \\"lambda\\",\\n            awsProfileName: this.argument.accountB.profile,\\n            stackProps: {\\n                env: {\\n                    region: this.argument.region,\\n                    account: this.argument.accountB.id\\n                }\\n            }\\n        })\\n}\\n```\\n\\n##### Update step\\n\\nWhen updating the resource, we deploy both the `Param` and `Lambda` stack.\\n```typescript src=\\"src/orbits/hello-resource.ts\\"\\nasync defineUpdate(){\\n        const lambdaResource = this.constructLambdaResource();\\n\\n        const lambdaOutput = await this.do(\\"getLambdaOutput\\", ()=>{\\n            return lambdaResource.getResourceOutput();\\n        })\\n\\n        const paramOutput = await this.do(\\"updateParam\\", this.constructParamResource(lambdaOutput));\\n\\n        await this.do(\\"updateLambda\\", this.constructLambdaResource(paramOutput))\\n}\\n```\\n\\n`ParamResource` consumes the output of `LambdaResource` and vice versa.\\nAs a consequence, we need to refine the constructs methods.\\n\\n```typescript src=\\"src/orbits/hello-resource.ts\\"\\n    constructLambdaResource(paramOutput? : ParamResource[\'IOutput\']){\\n        return new LambdaResource().setArgument({\\n            stackName: \\"lambda\\",\\n            awsProfileName: this.argument.accountB.profile,\\n            stackProps: {\\n                accountARoleArn: paramOutput?.roleArn,\\n                parameterArn: paramOutput?.paramArn,\\n                env: {\\n                    region: this.argument.region,\\n                    account: this.argument.accountB.id\\n                }\\n            }\\n        })\\n    }\\n\\n    constructParamResource(lambdaOutput? : LambdaResource[\'IOutput\']){\\n        return new ParamResource().setArgument({\\n            stackName: \\"param\\",\\n            awsProfileName: this.argument.accountA.profile,\\n            stackProps: {\\n                accountBId: this.argument.accountB.id,\\n                accountBRoleArn: lambdaOutput.roleArn,\\n                env: {\\n                    region: this.argument.region,\\n                    account: this.argument.accountA.id\\n                }\\n            }\\n        })\\n    }\\n```\\n\\n#### Uninstall step\\n\\nTo uninstall, we uninstall both the `Lambda` and `ParamStore` stacks.\\n\\n```typescript src=\\"src/orbits/hello-resource.ts\\"\\nasync defineUninstall(){\\n        await this.do(\\"uninstallLambda\\", this.constructLambdaResource().setCommand(\\"Uninstall\\"));\\n        await this.do(\\"uninstallParam\\", this.constructParamResource().setCommand(\\"Uninstall\\"))\\n}\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Deployment\\n\\nThe entire cross-account deployment happens with a single command:\\n\\n```bash\\nexport $(cat .env | xargs)\\nexport ORBITS_DB__MONGO__URL=your-mongo-url\\nnpx tsx src/orbits/orbi.ts\\n```\\n\\nThis orchestrates:\\n1. Parameter deployment in Account A\\n2. Cross-account IAM policy setup\\n3. Lambda function deployment in Account B\\n4. All necessary permissions and configurations\\n\\n#### Verification\\n\\nAfter deployment, you can test the Lambda function in Account B. It will successfully retrieve the parameter from Account A, demonstrating seamless cross-account access.\\n\\nThe Lambda logs will show:\\n```\\nParam: hello-world\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Cleanup\\nTo remove all deployed resources from both accounts:\\n```bash \\nexport HELLO_COMMAND=uninstall\\nnpx tsx src/orbits/orbi.ts\\n```\\n\u26a0\ufe0f Warning: This will permanently delete all resources created by this example. Make sure you want to remove everything before running this command.\\n\\n## Why This Matters\\n\\nThis example might seem simple, but it represents a fundamental gain in how we think about multi-account architectures. Instead of treating cross-account access as an exception requiring special handling, orbits makes it a first-class citizen of your infrastructure-as-code workflow. It allows to completly automate cross-account resources definition.\\n\\n### Key Benefits\\n\\n**Declarative Cross-Account Resources:** Reference any resource from any account without manual coordination.\\n\\n**Automatic Permission Management:** IAM policies and resource policies are handled automatically.\\n\\n**Consistent Deployment Experience:** Multi-account deployments feel the same as single-account ones.\\n\\n**Simplified Maintenance:** Updates and changes don\'t require manual ARN extraction and policy coordination.\\n\\n## Looking Forward\\n\\nCross-account resource management shouldn\'t be a second-class citizen in your infrastructure-as-code workflow. Tools like orbits point toward a future where account boundaries enhance security without sacrificing developer experience.\\n\\nIf you\'re building multi-account architectures, I encourage you to try this example and see how much simpler cross-account resource management can be. The days of manual ARN extraction and policy coordination don\'t have to be permanent fixtures of AWS multi-account architectures.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*Ready to try it yourself?

Yes, infrastructure has always been code: from the Ubuntu web server to the Cockroach database, it is nothing but code controlled by code. But if the Ops field has progressively shifted towards the notion of Infrastructure as Code, it is precisely because there is a substantial difference: the DevOps domain is better formalized as a description of reproducible artifacts rather than as a prescription of successive commands to execute.\\nThus, boldly displaying this slogan *Infra is code!* on any article should make any somewhat experienced DevOps practitioner pause.\\n\\nYet, friend reading these lines, don\u2019t go away so quickly! Haven\u2019t you already felt that while DevOps improved developers\u2019 lives with democratization of virtualization, convergence of interfaces, and unprecedented deployment speed, infrastructure itself remained, tucked away in some Git annex, a poor relative of computer code \u2014 difficult to edit, inflexible, and slow to test?\\nThe popular wisdom among developers seems to say: the less you touch infrastructure, the better off you are.\\nWith this, tirelessly, we arrive at a state-of-the-art where:\\n\\n- every project [restarts infrastructure work](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1l8dsax/whats_eating_up_most_of_your_time_as_a_devops/) as if its neighbor didn\u2019t exist\\n- building a service stack remains a patchwork, a [conglomerate of loosely connected elements](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2023.2229347)\\n- it is difficult, [without manual intervention, to redeploy an app from scratch on a new environment](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/documents/576/2019_019_001_539335.pdf).\\n- apps are [hardly portable from one cloud to another](https://theses.hal.science/tel-02798770/file/90479_BRABRA_2020_archivage-4.pdf) \u2014 and the question of sovereignty is, out of frustration, abandoned.\\n\\nFinally, all in all, a large part of DevOps activity remains manual, and the trust chain in the system relies on a chain of responsibility and a comprehensive understanding of the system by a few operators in the team (which is positive) rather than on appropriate tooling (which is disappointing because, as system complexity grows, [relying solely on knowledge leads to rigid systems](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74183-3_4)).\\n\\nConsequently, we unanimously demand that infrastructure specifications have the same rights and level of citizenship as any other piece of code in the stack.\\n\\nA demand that could remain dead letter if it were not accompanied by two recommendations:\\n\\norchestrators offer infrastructure an opportunity for liberation that it can seize to obtain its citizenship rights. The engineering platform movement has made a strong commitment in this direction and orchestration must be at the center of efforts.\\n\\nincreasingly, infrastructure benefits from being written in standard code: CDKs bear witness to the direction to follow. This allows a convergence of best practices between infrastructure and code.\\n\\nThus, IaC must be enhanced, orchestrated, and managed \u2014 as much as possible through standard code.\\nWe began working under these assumptions three years ago, and it has allowed us to build numerous engineering platforms since then. As we found nothing that met our criteria, we built our own orchestration framework: Orbits (aka Orbi.ts).\\nIt is now mature enough to fly on its own: since freedom is not won alone, we present it today to the community, hoping it can help build infrastructures and deployment pipelines that are more flexible, more robust, and more sovereign."}]}}')}}]);
