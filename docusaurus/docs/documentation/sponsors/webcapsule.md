## A Complete and Secure Internal Developer Platform in TypeScript

Webcapsule is a company specialized in building secure web infrastructures for highly regulated environments.
In such demanding contexts, infrastructures must be able to adapt to their environment and, as much as possible, self-regulate.

With strong opinions about how DevOps should be practiced, and after finding that existing tools—while powerful—often hinder operational performance and infrastructure resilience, Webcapsule made an early move toward building engineering platforms fully in TypeScript.

We believed the gap between software engineering best practices and infrastructure practices was too wide. That’s why we chose to rely on standard code—modular, testable, and easily reproducible—to bring the same level of software quality to infrastructure as found in traditional development.

Orbits is the result of that experience.
