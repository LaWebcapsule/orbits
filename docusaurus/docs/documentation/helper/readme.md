# Pilot your IaC

Orbits comes with a set of pre-built tools to help you pilot and orchestrate your IaC.
The package `@orbi-ts/fuel` provides constructors to turn your IaC into orchestrated resources. It is organized into three main helpers:

- [Integrations](./integrations/): Adapt IaC languages into programmatic workflows. They extend your IaC capabilities and enable cross-account, cross-environment, and cross-service resource consumption.

- [Executors](./remote-execution/): Provide constructors to run actions in remote environments. For example, you can bootstrap a database inside a private network.

- [Distribution](./distribution/): Offer constructors to easily distribute your predefined IaC via API or CLI.
