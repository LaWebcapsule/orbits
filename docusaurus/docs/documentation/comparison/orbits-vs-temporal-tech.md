# Orbits vs Temporal

Orbits and Temporal are workflow orchestration frameworks, but they target very different domains. Temporal excels at orchestrating distributed business logic and application-level workflows, while Orbits is specialized in orchestrating infrastructure and cloud resources.

| Feature                        | Orbits                                               | Temporal                              |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Primary Language**           | TypeScript                                           | Go, Java, Python, TypeScript          |
| **Approach**                   | Imperative infrastructure orchestration              | Imperative, distributed workflow engine|
| **Use Case Focus**             | Cloud infrastructure and resource lifecycle          | Application-level workflows           |
| **State Persistence**          | Tracks and persists infrastructure state             | Full event history of workflow states |
| **Error Handling**             | Retroactive feedback loops and corrective actions    | Retry policies and signal handling    |
| **Scalability**                | Designed for multi-cloud and multi-tenant orchestration| Massive scale for business workflows |
| **Integration Ecosystem**      | Full Node.js ecosystem, cloud SDKs                   | Temporal SDKs for app workflows       |

## Technical Analysis   
Temporal is ideal for developers building distributed systems that require long-running workflows and complex coordination logic. Orbits, on the other hand, is optimized for DevOps teams managing infrastructure deployments, offering multi-cloud orchestration and state management out of the box.

**When to choose Orbits:**  
For orchestrating infrastructure resources, deployments, and multi-cloud workflows.  
**When to choose Temporal:**  
For orchestrating application-level workflows and business processes across distributed systems.
