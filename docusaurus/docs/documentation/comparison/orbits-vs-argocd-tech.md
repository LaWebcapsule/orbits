# Orbits vs ArgoCD

Orbits and ArgoCD both enable DevOps automation, but they differ in abstraction level and scope. ArgoCD is specialized for GitOps-based application deployment on Kubernetes, whereas Orbits manages full infrastructure orchestration across clouds.

| Feature                        | Orbits                                               | ArgoCD                               |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Primary Language**           | TypeScript                                           | YAML (Kustomize, Helm)               |
| **Approach**                   | Imperative workflows with dynamic logic              | Declarative GitOps                   |
| **Multi-cloud & Multi-tenant** | ‚úÖ Native                                             | üü° Limited (multi-cluster support)   |
| **Infrastructure Orchestration**| ‚úÖ Full support                                       | ‚ùå Focused on Kubernetes apps        |
| **Error Handling**             | Feedback loops, dynamic retries                      | Sync checks and manual intervention |
| **Main Focus**                 | End-to-end infrastructure lifecycle                  | Kubernetes application deployment    |
| **Extensibility**              | Full programmatic control with Node.js               | Tied to Kubernetes and GitOps        |

## Technical Analysis  
Orbits offers more flexibility for orchestrating entire infrastructure lifecycles, supporting non-Kubernetes workloads and multi-cloud environments. ArgoCD shines in Kubernetes GitOps scenarios but lacks broader orchestration capabilities.

**When to choose Orbits:**  
When managing multi-cloud infrastructure, tenants, and non-K8s resources.  
**When to choose ArgoCD:**  
When you need a GitOps tool for managing Kubernetes applications.
